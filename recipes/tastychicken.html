    <h3>The Dish</h3>
    <p>From the looks of it, it's a half breast cut lengthwise and rolled in spiced cornstarch. Probably something turmeric heavy like a curry spice. Browned in oil on the stovetop and then finished in the oven, do people do that with chicken? </p>
    <p>Another way to get that good browning is to preheat the pan in the oven, but to get the cornstarch to turn into something tasty you really need the oil - maybe it was all done in the pan. What do I know, am I a chef? No, I'm just a person who grabbed a photo off unsplash.</p>
    <h3>The Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken breast. I prefer thigh, but that's not in the picture.</li>
        <li>Asparagus spears. Buy four. Go to the store just for this. Yeah, I know they're expensive and they make your pee smell funny. It's okay, they're just to make the picture pretty.</li>
        <li>Cherry tomatoes. Just tear open a pack and shove four in your pockets. No, wait - your cheeks! That's better. If you get caught, you can always pop them with your hands and claim you're having a medical emergency.</li>
        <li>I forgot to count the pieces of corn. Really, let's just call everything optional. Even the chicken. If you really wanted to be cooking, you wouldn't be on this website, would you? You'd be making food. Michaelina's it is!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Steps</h3>

        <li>open a can of dollar store soup and eat cold because you can't afford to pay the electric.</li>
